I would not have thought that the school I am attending is right at the foot of 101, and going in and out of the Shifu metro station every month has become my daily routine, seeing 101 too much that I don’t want to look at it any more XD The four years back and forth between Taipei and Yilan has given me this feeling: pedestrians in Yilan have always had a slow pace, while there are a lot of people in Taipei, and they come and go in a hurry. Everyone seems to have a destination that they are eager to reach, how should I put it, unlike the profluently flowing water, but the kind of water splashed on the stones by the waterfall. <span class='revealE'>Not a single</span> drop has the same direction, <span class='revealE'>that's about how it is</span>.

And of anything related to <span class='revealE'>human</span> beings’ basic living demands, such as food, clothing, living, and commuting, one can be <span class='revealE'>easily satisfied in different</span> corners of Taipei. However, there are also many obstacles and difficulties one needs to overcome if one chooses to reside in Taipei, for example, the expensive living expenses in a city, a small and cramped living space, and a compact and unrelaxing living pace. These are all <span class='revealE'>basic</span> living conditions which a back-busted Taipei citizen must overcome. For many years, I can deeply feel the <span class='revealE'>ever-growing and advancing energy</span> of this city, such as the many newly planned MRT lines, public infrastructure, and business districts, those that are gradually changing the skyline of this CBD. What’s a bit pity is that in this metropolitan, there are still too many old apartments to date, of which the far ages of their plannings and constructions have caused the citizens’ uncomfortableness in their living spaces, and also aftereffects like having a not-graceful-enough city image. I hope that in the future development of the city, I could have the chance to expect a prettier city landscape, and lots of living environments that are more comfortable for the many citizens.</p>",
