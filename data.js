As I passed the gate of Eslite (Shifu Station division), <span class='revealE'>I thought to myself, wow,</span> I was so close to 101. It was so tall. Every corner in Taipei is too different from that of Yilan; over the Hsuehshan Tunnel it is a completely different world. I would not have thought that the school I am attending is right at the foot of 101, and going in and out of the Shifu metro station every month has become my daily routine, seeing 101 too much that I don’t want to look at it any more XD The four years back and forth between Taipei and Yilan has given me this feeling: pedestrians in Yilan have always had a slow pace, while there are a lot of people in Taipei, and they come and go in a hurry. Everyone seems to have a destination that they are eager to reach, how should I put it, unlike the profluently flowing water, but the kind of water splashed on the stones by the waterfall. <span class='revealE'>Not a single</span> drop has the same direction, <span class='revealE'>that's about how it is</span>. So in Taipei, I feel like if I don’t set my compass, I will feel very lost, owing that this is a city with countless hidden road signs. Now that I am graduating, I will still stay in Taipei. I think it is <span class='revealE'>not a bad</span> place after getting used to it.
